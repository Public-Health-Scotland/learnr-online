## Introduction

Welcome to **SQL in R**. This is a self-led course on accessing and utilising databases within Public Health Scotland, particularly SQL databases, in R. Throughout this course there will be quizzes to test your knowledge and opportunities to modify and write both R and SQL code.

### What is SQL?

SQL (you can read about the [pronounciation *conflict* here](https://database.guide/is-it-pronounced-s-q-l-or-sequel/)) is the **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage used to interact with relational databases. This is, by far, the most popular database structure and for our purposes makes storing and interacting with data so much more efficient. 

A relational database is just like a collection of tables, rows and columns, like an Excel spreadsheet. Each table represents a single entity, columns (or fields) represent attributes, and rows (or records) represent information about a single entity.

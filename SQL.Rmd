### Database Setup
# Load data
borders_data <- readRDS("www/data/borders.rds")

# Create a connection to the database
conn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")

# Write data into a table within the database
dbWriteTable(conn, "borders_data", borders_data, overwrite = TRUE)

# List tables available in the database
dbListTables(conn)
```


```{r phs-logo, echo=FALSE, fig.align='right', out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/phs-logo.png")
```

## Introduction

Welcome to **SQL in R**. This is a self-led course on accessing and utilising databases within Public Health Scotland, particularly SQL databases, in R. Throughout this course there will be quizzes to test your knowledge and opportunities to modify and write both R and SQL code.

### What is SQL?

SQL (you can read about the [pronounciation *conflict* here](https://database.guide/is-it-pronounced-s-q-l-or-sequel/)) is the **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage used to interact with relational databases. This is, by far, the most popular database structure and for our purposes makes storing and interacting with data so much more efficient. 

A relational database is just like a collection of tables, rows and columns, like an Excel spreadsheet. Each table represents a single entity, columns (or fields) represent attributes, and rows (or records) represent information about a single entity. Have a look at the below table as an example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
graphics_grammar_table <- data.frame(
  "ID" = c("1", "2", "3"),
  "Name" = c("Harry", "Luna", "Ronald"),
  "Specialty" = c("A1", "A11", "A2"),
  "LoS" = c("5", "7", "9"),
  "HB_Res" = c("S08000031", "S08000024", "S08000031"),
  "HB_Treat" = c("S08000031", "S08000031", "S08000031")
)

kableExtra::kbl(graphics_grammar_table) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE)

```

```{r intro-quiz}
quiz(
  question("How many records are in the above table?",
           answer("0"),
           answer("1"),
           answer("2"),
           answer("3", correct = TRUE),
           answer("4"),
           incorrect = "Not quite, have another go!",
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = FALSE
  ),
  question("What was the LoS (Length of Stay) for Luna?",
           answer("5"),
           answer("9"),
           answer("7", correct = TRUE),
           answer("2"),
           incorrect = "Not quite, have another go!",
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```

PHS have many databases for different purposes, with varying technical infrastructures (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL) they all utilise a common language, SQL (albeit with some differences as things get more advanced). This course will minimise the need to interact with any live PHS database but still reference and make sure the knowledge gained is transferable. We'll stay practical in this course though, building knowledge and skill by:

1. Learning the basics of how to use SQL
2. Implementing SQL within R
3. Top it off with a Tidyverse package, [`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/), used to interact with databases with the Tidyverse style of coding.

RStudio has functionality to make connecting to and interacting with databases slightly easier but the real power comes from including the SQL code in-line with your R code. This means there's no interruption to your workflow, you can include it within your automation pipelines, and add supporting data manipulation code in R. However, R relies on processing power and memory and larger data extracts can have an exponential impact on performance. We'll therefore go over writing efficient queries and other best practice to make our lives that bit easier.

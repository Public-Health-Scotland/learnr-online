## Introduction

Welcome to SPSS to R. This course is designed as a self-led introduction to R from SPSS and is for anyone in Public Health Scotland with experience of SPSS. The aim of this course is to bridge the understanding of each technology, giving translations where possible but generally supporting the transition. Throughout this course there will be quizzes to test your knowledge and opportunities to modify and write R code. 

This course aims to follow the path set out by the [Introduction to R](https://public-health-scotland.github.io/knowledge-base/develop/introduction-to-r) course, the structure of which is below. Both courses should be used in conjunction and neither replaces the other.

```{r intro-pathway, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-intro-pathway-2.png")

  <h4>Course Info</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This course is built to flow through sections and build on previous knowledge. If you're comfortable with a particular section, you can skip it.</li>
    <li>Most sections have multiple parts to them. Navigate the course by using the buttons at the bottom of the screen to Continue or go to the Next Topic.</li>
    <li>The course will also show progress through sections, a green tick will appear on sections you've completed, and it will remember your place if you decide to close your browser and come back later.</li>

#### Comparison of Technologies

```{r r-vs-spss, echo=FALSE}
r_vs_spss <- data.frame(
  "R" = c("A *programming language* widely used for data analysis, statistics, and graphics.",
          "Open source and available on all major operating systems",
          "Has the functionality to go from raw data to interactive reports, web apps, and more.",
          "A part of the PHS analytical strategy."),
  "SPSS" = c("Software used for statistical analysis mainly in the social sciences, providing users with an interface for building tasks as well as a *command syntax language*.",
             "Non-extensible, proprietary software.",
             "Predetermined statistical analysis tools and visualisations.",
             "Decreasing use across industry and PHS licenses will expire early 2023.")
)

kableExtra::kbl(r_vs_spss) %>% 
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "50%")

```

</br>

While the use of SPSS is decreasing across industries and academia, the use of other tools such as R (and Python) are increasing, a large part due to their open source nature. Being open source allows communities to build around them for support, gives users more control in how they use and extend them, and maintains transferability (preventing work being locked into a single tool). PHS has and continues to invest in building the infrastructure to support R into the future, ensuring the whole workflow is as seamless as possible. 

</br>

Since we're getting started, here's a quiz to get familiar with the layout:

```{r intro-quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which of the following relate only to R (and not SPSS)?",
    answer("Programming language", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Proprietary software", message = "Thankfully, R is open-source and extendable through packages. SPSS is proprietary software."),
    answer("Open-source", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Interactive reports & web apps", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Presentations", correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = "Not quite, make sure to only select the statements that apply to R!",
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

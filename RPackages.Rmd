## Introduction

Welcome to R Packages. This course is designed as a self-led introduction for anyone in Public Health Scotland. Throughout this course there will be quizzes to test your knowledge and opportunities to modify and write R code. This course focusses on building an understanding of packages from a development side, contributing to existing packages, and finally building your own packages.

### What is an R package?

An R package is essentially a collection of R functions They usually also include helpful information about each function, examples of how to use them and tests to make sure they work as they should. You'll probably be familiar with packages and use them already.


## Foundations
=======
An R package is essentially a collection of R functions. They usually also include helpful information about each function, examples of how to use them and tests to make sure they work as they should.

You are probably familiar with installing and using R packages, e.g.:

```{r familiar, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)
```

...

If you don't know how to write functions with R, we suggest having a look at our course on that topic <LINK TO FUNCTIONS COURSE> before proceeding with this one.

### What's the point of packages?

The philosophy behind creating R packages is to collate functions written to make a specific task easier. If you do not have your commonly used functions in a package, then you may end up complicating your R scripts by having to define a lot of functions before you can get into what the script is actually supposed to do. For example:

```{r scriptStart, eval = FALSE}
# functions ---------------------------------------------------------------
mean_by_age <- function(data) {
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
}

summarise_column <- function(data, col_name) {
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
}

more functions...
...
...

# start of script ---------------------------------------------------------

The real script...

```

This not only makes scripts more complex and harder to read, but it can mean that you have function definitions across many different scripts. So if you want to make an improvement to one of your functions, you're going to need to find all the places you have defined it and change it in every instance. 

If your functions are not well managed, you can end up with differently defined functions with the same (or similar) names in different scripts. This can give you unexpected results if those functions do slightly different things.

R packages solve these problems by defining your functions in one place, and documenting them. This means that whenever you use a function, you know exactly what it's going to do. And it saves space in your scripts, making them more readable and easier to work on collaboratively.

### Structure of an R package

### Where are R packages? (GitHub and CRAN)

## Contributing to an R package

There are two main reasons you might want to contribute to an R package:
- To address a problem/issue within the package
- To expand what it can do (e.g., by adding a new function)

### Correcting/improving existing functions

### Adding new functions

You may have an idea for a function that would fit in well with a package.
Perhaps you have written a function that you often use in conjunction with that package.

For example, if you use `create_age_groups()` from our {phsmethods} package, you might find that you often want to summarise a dataset by age group after those groups have been created. So you could write a function that does this, and propose that it be added to {phsmethods} for others to use.

To add a function to a package, you will usually have to 'fork' or add a branch to the package's repository on GitHub. Then you can make changes to the package's code safely, without worrying about disrupting the package until you are finished making your changes.

Once you have done this you can create a new file in the folder named "R", where the R functions associated with a package are stored. The file should be named something like function-name.R, where you substitute "function-name" for the actual function name. Our new function for {phsmethods} will be called `mean_by_age()` so we will create a new file in the 'R' folder called 'mean_by_age.R'

Inside that file, we will write the code that defines our function. In this case, we will make a function that takes a dataframe, the name of the column containing age groups and the name of the column we want to summarise.

```{r}
mean_by_age <- function(data, age_col, summary_col) {
  data %>% group_by(across(age_col)) %>% 
    summarise(
      mean_age = mean(.data[[summary_col]])
    )
}
```

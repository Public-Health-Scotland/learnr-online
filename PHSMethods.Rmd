## Introduction

Welcome to PHS Methods training. This course is designed as a self-led introduction to the internally developed `phsmethods` package for use in Public Health Scotland. Throughout this course there will be quizzes to test your knowledge and opportunities to modify and write R code. The course is split with a section for each function in the package.

### Overview

The package, `phsmethods`, can be used on desktop and server versions of RStudio. It contains functions for common analytical tasks in Public Health Scotland (PHS). The package is also intended to be in continuous development, with contributions to fixing typos, bugs, and even new functions are all very much encouraged. To learn more about contributing, see [this section on GitHub](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsmethods#contributing-to-phsmethods).

These are the current functions in the package which are included in this training app. As more functions are added, the aim is to include them here too. As such, this training can be treated as modular and each section is self-contained:

[`age_group()`](#age_group) [`chi_check()`](#chi_check) [`chi_pad()`](#chi_pad) [`file_size()`](#file_size) [`fin_year()`](#fin_year) [`match_area()`](#match_area) [`postcode()`](#postcode) and the [quarters](#quarters) functions.

### How to Use

The `phsmethods` package is just like any other package. However, it is not *currently* hosted on CRAN which means it needs to be installed from GitHub **or** a local copy of the GitHub repo. These methods are outlined below to get you started. Once the package is installed, it will show in your list of packages on RStudio.

#### Install from GitHub

For this method, the package `remotes` is required. If you don't already have this installed, it's on CRAN so run `install.packages("remotes")`. The `phsmethods` package can then be installed on RStudio from GitHub with:

```{r phsmethods-install, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Public-Health-Scotland/phsmethods", upgrade = "never")
```

#### Install from Local Copy

It may be necessary to install from a local copy. This is most likely the case if you want to install on RStudio Desktop and network security settings are preventing access to the `remotes::install_github()` function. You'll still need the `remotes` package installed, as above, so if you don't have it installed, run `install.packages("remotes")`. Then, there's 2 steps:

1. Download a [zip of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsmethods/archive/master.zip)
2. Run the following code, replacing `<>` with the file-path of the zipped file (remember to remove the `<>` symbols too.):

```{r phsmethods-install-local, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
remotes::install_local("<FILEPATH OF ZIPPED FILE>/phsmethods-master.zip", upgrade = "never")
```

#### Load

At this point, it's just the same as any other installed package, just run `library()` when you want to use it in your current session:

```{r phsmethods-load, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(phsmethods)
```


## create_age_groups()

The function, `create_age_groups()`, categorises ages into groups. The function takes a number of arguments:

- `x` - a vector of numeric values (e.g. `c(1, 2, 3, 21, 18, 88, 91)`)
- `from` - the start of the smallest age group (*default is 0*)
- `to` - the end of the largest age group (*default is 90*)
- `by` - the size of the age groups (*default is 5*)
- `as_factor` - the default behaviour is to return a character vector, assigning `TRUE` to this argument will return a factor vector instead (*default is FALSE*)

**If `to` is not a multiple of `by`, it'll be rounded down to the nearest multiple of `by`.**

#### Exercise

Have a look and click 'Run Code' below to see the output. Then, change the code to return age groups from 0 to 80 in groups of 10.

```{r create_age_groups-example, exercise=TRUE}
ages <- c(54, 7, 77, 1, 26, 101)

create_age_groups(ages)
```

```{r create_age_groups-example-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, c("50-59", "0-9", "70-79", "0-9", "20-29", "80+"))),
  fail_if(~ identical(.result, c("50-54", "5-9", "75-79", "0-4", "25-29", "90+")), message = "Have you changed the groups? Read the exercise again and use the list of arguments above to construct the right function."),
  fail_if(~ TRUE)
)
```


## chi_check()

The CHI (Community Health Index) is a register of all patients in NHS Scotland. Each CHI number is a unique, 10-digit, identifier assigned to each patient on the index. 

- **Digits 1 - 6** are a patients date of birth in DDMMYY format. As an example of a check, the first number must be 3 or less.
- **Digits 7 - 8** are additional digits to create the unique number.
- **Digit 9** identifies a patient's sex, odd for men, even for women. 
- **Digit 10** is a check digit, denoted 'checksum'.

The function, `chi_check()`, takes a CHI number or a vector of CHI numbers with a `character` class (see why `character below). It returns feedback on the validity of the CHI number(s) and, if found to be invalid, provides detail on why. The function only takes one argument, and that's the CHI number(s).

*While a CHI number is made exclusively of numeric digits, it cannot be stored as a `numeric` class. This is because a leading `0` in numeric values are silently dropped. For this reason, `chi_check()` accepts input values of `character` class only. A leading `0` can be added to a 9-digit CHI number using [`chi_pad()`](#chi_pad).*

These are the criteria `chi_check()` validates:

- no non-numeric characters
- 10 digits in length
- first 6 digits represent a valid date
- the checksum digit is correct

The result of `chi_check()` is a character string. Depending on the validity of the CHI number, it will return one of the following:

- 'Valid CHI'
- 'Invalid character(s) present'
- 'Too many characters'
- 'Too few characters'
- 'Invalid date'
- 'Invalid checksum'
- 'Missing (NA)'
- 'Missing (Blank)'

Have a look and click 'Run Code' below to see the output.

```{r chi_check-example, exercise=TRUE}
chi_numbers_check <- c("0101011237", "3213201234", "123456789", "12345678900", "010120123?")

chi_check(chi_numbers_check)
```

```{r chi_check-quiz}
quiz(
  question("What is the result of checking this CHI number `2611210001`",
    answer("Valid CHI"),
    answer("Invalid character(s) present"),
    answer("Too many characters"),
    answer("Too few characters"),
    answer("Invalid date"),
    answer("Invalid checksum", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Missing (Blank)"),
    incorrect = "Not quite. Try running the CHI number in the code chunk above.",
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```


## chi_pad()

The CHI (Community Health Index) is a register of all patients in NHS Scotland. Each CHI number is a unique, 10-digit, identifier assigned to each patient on the index. The first 6 digits are a patients date of birth in DDMMYY format. Depending on the source, CHI numbers may have a missing leading `0`.

*While a CHI number is made exclusively of numeric digits, it cannot be stored as a `numeric` class. This is because a leading `0` in numeric values are silently dropped. For this reason, `chi_check()` accepts input values of `character` class only. A leading `0` can be added to a 9-digit CHI number using [`chi_pad()`](#chi_pad).* **The function does not check for validity, in this case the [`chi_check()`](#chi_check) function should be used.**

The function, `chi_pad()`, takes a CHI number with `character` class and, if it's 9 digits, adds a leading zero (`0`). Any values provided which are not a string comprised of 9 numeric digits are left unchanged. The function only takes one argument, and that's the CHI number(s).

Have a look and click 'Run Code' below to see the output.

```{r chi_pad-example, exercise=TRUE}
chi_numbers_pad <- c("101011237", "101201234", "3213201234", "123223", "abcdefghi", "12345tuvw")

chi_pad(chi_numbers_pad)
```


## file_size()

The `file_size()` function takes a file-path, with an optional regular expression pattern, and returns the names and sizes of files in that file-path which match the given pattern. The function takes 2 arguments:

- `filepath` - a character string denoting a file-path (*default is working directory, `getwd()`*)
- `pattern` - an optional character string denoting a [regular expression](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html) pattern (*default is `NULL`*). For more on regular expressions, see this [Jumping Rivers blog post](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/regular-expressions-every-r-programmer-should-know/).

The sizes of files with certain extensions are returned with the type of file prefixed. For example, the size of a 12 KB `.xlsx` file is returned as 'Excel 12 KB'. File sizes are returned as the appropriate multiple of the unit byte (bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), etc.). Each multiple is taken to be 1,024 units of the preceding denomination. The complete list of handled file extensions and their output prefixes are as follows:

- `.xls`, `.xlsb`, `.xlsm` and `.xlsx` files are prefixed with *'Excel'*
- `.csv` files are prefixed with *'CSV'*
- `.sav` and `.zsav` files are prefixed with *'SPSS'*
- `.doc`, `.docm` and `.docx` files are prefixed with *'Word'*
- `.rds` files are prefixed with *'RDS'*
- `.txt` files are prefixed with *'Text',*
- `.fst` files are prefixed with *'FST',*
- `.pdf` files are prefixed with *'PDF',*
- `.tsv` files are prefixed with *'TSV',*
- `.html` files are prefixed with *'HTML',*
- `.ppt`, `.pptm` and `.pptx` files are prefixed with *'PowerPoint',*
- `.md` files are prefixed with *'Markdown'*

Files with extensions not contained within this list will have their size returned with no prefix. To request that a certain extension be explicitly catered for, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/phsmethods/issues).

The output from the function is a tibble listing the names of files within `filepath` which match `pattern` and their respective sizes. The column names of this tibble are `'name'` and `'size'`. If no pattern is specified, `file_size()` returns the names and sizes of all files within `filepath.` File names and sizes are returned in alphabetical order of file name. Sub-folders contained within `filepath` will return a file size of '0 B'. If `filepath` is an empty folder, or `pattern` matches no files within `filepath`, `file_size()` returns NULL.

*Unfortunately, it's not possible to have the code exercises in this course reach directories. So a run example with output is given below.*

```{r file_size-example, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
file_size(pattern = "\\.xlsx$")
```

```{r file_size-example-output, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# A tibble: 3 x 2
  name             size       
  <chr>            <chr>      
1 aa.xls           Excel 6 KB
2 borders.xlsx     Excel 4 KB 
3 fife.xlsx        Excel 2 KB
```

```{r file_size-quiz}
quiz(
  question("What file types are **not** prefixed by `file_size()`?",
    answer("Excel (`.xls`, `.xlsb`, `.xlsm` and `.xlsx`)"),
    answer("SPSS (`.sav` and `.zsav`)"),
    answer("Markdown (`.md`)"),
    answer("RMarkdown (`.Rmd`)", correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = "Not quite. Have a look at the list above.",
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("Which file size will not be returned by `file_size()`?",
    answer("0 B"),
    answer("256 B"),
    answer("1250 B", correct = TRUE),
    answer("20 KB"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```


## extract_fin_year()

The function, `extract_fin_year()`, takes a date and assigns to a financial year in the PHS specified format `YYYY/YY`, e.g. 2017/18. The function takes only 1 argument, the date. The date which is supplied must be in the class `Date` or `POSIXct`, `as.Date()`, `lubridate::dmy()` and `as.POSIXct()` are examples of functions which can be used to store dates as an appropriate class.

Have a look and click 'Run Code' below to see the output.

```{r extract_fin_year-example, exercise=TRUE}
dates <- lubridate::dmy(c(21012017, 04042017, 17112017))

extract_fin_year(dates)
```


## match_area()

The function, `match_area()`, converts geography codes (or a vector of geography codes), matches to the single corresponding value in the [`area_lookup` dataset](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsmethods/blob/master/data-raw/area_lookup.R), and returns the equivalent area name(s). The function only takes 1 argument, the geography code(s).

Current and previous versions of geography codes (e.g. 2014 and 2019 Health Boards) are catered for. The standard 9 digit geography codes are the only exempted by:

- `RA2701`: No Fixed Abode
- `RA2702`: Rest of UK (Outside Scotland)
- `RA2703`: Outside the UK
- `RA2704`: Unknown Residency

The `match_area()` function handles codes related to:

- Health Boards
- Council Areas
- Health and Social Care Partnerships
- Intermediate Zones, Data Zones (2001 and 2011)
- Electoral Wards
- Scottish Parliamentary Constituencies
- UK Parliamentary Constituencies
- Travel to work areas
- National Parks
- Community Health Partnerships
- Localities (S19)
- Settlements (S20)
- Scotland

If an exact match is not found in the `area_lookup` dataset, an `NA` value will be returned. The exact matching is sensitive to both case and spacing. If an unexpected result is produced, it's worth comparing the input data to the `area_lookup` dataset for any differences.

Have a look and click 'Run Code' below to see the output.

```{r match_area-example, exercise=TRUE}
areas <- c("S02000656", "S02001042", "S08000020", "S12000013", "S13002605")

match_area(areas)
```


## format_postcode()

The `format_postcode()` function takes a character string or vector of character strings, extracts the input values which adhere to the standard UK postcode format (with or without spaces), and formats by assigning the appropriate spacing to them (for pc7 and pc8 formats) and ensures all letters are capitalised. The function takes two arguments:

- `x`- a character string or vector of character strings. This input is validated and must be in the standard UK postcode format (excluding case and spacing). Any values not in this format will result in an `NA` and warning (warnings will not prevent the execution of a whole vector, compared to errors which will stop all execution of the function). Warnings are also generated where input contains lower case letters to explain that they will be capitalised.
- `format` - a character string to determine the desired output format. Options are 'pc7' and 'pc8' (*default is 'pc7'*)

- **pc7** - character string of length 7. 7 character postcodes have no space, 6 character postcodes have 1 space after the 2nd character, 5 character postcodes have 2 spaces after the 2nd character.
- **pc8** - character string of maximum length 8. All postcodes have 1 space before the last 3 characters.

The standard format for UK postcodes is:

- 1/2 letters - followed by
- 1 number - followed by
- 1 letter or number (optional) - followed by
- 1 number - followed by
- 2 letters

*[UK government regulations](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/283357/ILRSpecification2013_14Appendix_C_Dec2012_v1.pdf) mandate which letters and numbers can be used in specific sections of a postcode. However, these regulations are liable to change over time. For this reason, `format_postcode()` does not validate whether a given postcode actually exists, or whether specific numbers and letters are being used in the appropriate places. It only assesses whether the given input is consistent with the above format and, if so, assigns the appropriate amount of spacing and capitalises any lower case letters.*

Have a look and click 'Run Code' below to see the output. Read the warnings output and see if you can understand where they've come from.

```{r format_postcode-example, exercise=TRUE}
postcodes <- c("G26QE", "KA89NB", "PA152TY", "G 4 2 9 B A", "g207al", "Dg98bS", "DD37J    y", "80210")

format_postcode(postcodes)
```

#### Exercise 

Have a look and click 'Run Code' below to see the output. The default format is 'pc7', change the output to be 'pc8'?

```{r pc8-example, exercise=TRUE}
postcodes_pc8 <- c("G26QE", "KA89NB", "PA152TY", "G 4 2 9 B A", "g207al", "Dg98bS", "DD37J    y", "80210")

format_postcode(postcodes_pc8)
```

```{r pc8-example-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result, c("G2 6QE", "KA8 9NB", "PA15 2TY", "G42 9BA", "G20 7AL", "DG9 8BS", "DD3 7JY", NA))),
  fail_if(~ identical(.result, c("G2  6QE", "KA8 9NB", "PA152TY", "G42 9BA", "G20 7AL", "DG9 8BS", "DD3 7JY", NA)), message = "Try changing the output format to be pc8."),
  fail_if(~ TRUE)
)
```


## Quarters

This section contains [`qtr()`](), [`qtr_end()`](), [`qtr_next()`](), and [`qtr_prev()`]() which are used to assign dates to quarters. The `qtr` functions take a date input and calculates the relevant quarter-related value from it. They all return the year as part of its value:

- `qtr()` returns the current quarter
- `qtr_end()` returns the last month in the quarter
- `qtr_next()` returns the next quarter
- `qtr_prev()` returns the previous quarter

Each variant of the functions takes 2 arguments:

- `date` - a date supplied with `date` class.
- `format` - a character string specifying the format the quarter should be displayed in. Valid options are 'long' (e.g. January to March 2018) and 'short' (e.g. Jan-Mar 2018). (*Default is 'long'*).

Quarters are defined as:

- January to March / Jan-Mar
- April to June / Apr-Jun
- July to September / Jul-Sep
- October to December / Oct-Dec

  fail_if(~ TRUE)
)
```


## age_calculate()

This function, `age_calculate()`, calculates the age between two dates using `lubridate`. It calculates age in either years or months. The function takes four arguments:

- `start` - A start date (e.g. date of birth) which must be supplied with `Date` or `POSIXct` or `POSIXlt` class. `as.Date()`, `lubridate::dmy()` and `as.POSIXct()` are examples of functions which can be used to store dates as an appropriate class.

- `end` - An end date which must be supplied with `Date` or `POSIXct` or `POSIXlt` class. Default is `Sys.Date()` or `Sys.time()` depending on the class of `start`.

- `units` - Type of units to be used. years and months are accepted. Default is `years`.

- `round_down` - Should returned ages be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Default is `TRUE`.

Have a look and click ‘Run Code’ below to see the output.

```{r age_calculate-example, exercise=TRUE}
my_date <- as.Date("2020-02-29")
end_date <- as.Date("2022-07-11")

age_calculate(my_date, end_date)
```


## dob_from_chi()

This function, `dob_from_chi()`, takes a CHI number or a vector of CHI numbers and returns the DoB as implied by the CHI number(s). If the DoB is ambiguous it will return `NA`. The function takes four arguments:

- `chi_number` - a CHI number or a vector of CHI numbers with `character` class. 

- `min_date` and `max_date` - optional min and/or max dates that the Date of Birth could take as the century needs to be guessed. Must be either length 1 for a 'fixed' date, or the same length as `chi_number` for a date per CHI number if it's a vector. `min_date` can be date based on common sense in the dataset, whilst `max_date` can be date when an event happens such as discharge date.

- `chi_check` - logical, optionally skip checking the CHI for validity which will be faster but should only be used if you have previously checked the CHI(s). The default (`TRUE`) will check the CHI numbers.

Have a look and click ‘Run Code’ below to see the output.

```{r dob_from_chi-example, exercise=TRUE}
data <- tibble(chi = c(
  "0101336489",
  "0101405073",
  "0101625707"
), adm_date = as.Date(c(
  "1950-01-01",
  "2000-01-01",
  "2020-01-01"
)))

data %>%
  mutate(chi_dob = dob_from_chi(chi,
    min_date = as.Date("1930-01-01"),
    max_date = adm_date
  ))
```

#### Exercise

In the last example, we set the minimum date as `1930-01-01`. How about changing it to `1940-01-01` and see what happens? 

```{r min_date-example, exercise=TRUE}
data <- tibble(chi = c(
  "0101336489",
  "0101405073",
  "0101625707"
), adm_date = as.Date(c(
  "1950-01-01",
  "2000-01-01",
  "2020-01-01"
)))

data %>%
  mutate(chi_dob = dob_from_chi(chi,
    min_date = as.Date("1930-01-01"),
    max_date = adm_date
  ))
```

```{r min_date-example-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result[[1, 3]], as.Date(NA))),
  fail_if(~ identical(.result[[1, 3]], as.Date("1933-01-01")), message = "Try changing the minimum date to 1940-01-01."),
  fail_if(~ TRUE)
)
```

As you can see the date of birth of the first record is `NA`, as it can either be 1933 or 2033 - 1933 is not within the range between minimum year 1940 and admission year 1950, 2033 is a future year, so it has to be returned as `NA`. 

## age_from_chi()

This function, `age_from_chi()`, takes a CHI number or a vector of CHI numbers and returns the age as implied by the CHI number(s). If the DoB is ambiguous it will return `NA`. It uses `dob_from_chi`. The function takes five arguments:

- `chi_number` - a CHI number or a vector of CHI numbers with `character` class.

- `ref_date` - calculate the age at this date, default is to use `Sys.Date()` i.e. today.

- `min_age` and `max_age` - optional min and/or max dates that the Date of Birth could take as the century needs to be guessed. Must be either length 1 for a 'fixed' age, or the same length as `chi_number` for an age per CHI number if it's a vector. `min_age` can be age based on common sense in the dataset, whilst `max_age` can be age when an event happens such as the age at discharge.

- `chi_check` - logical, optionally skip checking the CHI for validity which will be faster but should only be used if you have previously checked the CHI(s), the default (`TRUE`) will to check the CHI numbers.

```{r age_from_chi-example, exercise=TRUE}
data <- tibble(chi = c(
  "0101336489",
  "0101405073",
  "0101625707"
), dis_date = as.Date(c(
  "1950-01-01",
  "2000-01-01",
  "2020-01-01"
)))

data %>%
  mutate(chi_age = age_from_chi(chi))
```

#### Exercise

In the last example, the default ref_date is date of today. How about calculating the age at date of discharge (dis_date)?

```{r dis_date-example, exercise=TRUE}
data <- tibble(chi = c(
  "0101336489",
  "0101405073",
  "0101625707"
), dis_date = as.Date(c(
  "1950-01-01",
  "2000-01-01",
  "2020-01-01"
)))

data %>%
  mutate(chi_age = age_from_chi(chi))
```

```{r dis_date-example-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ identical(.result[[3]], c(17, 60, 58))),
  fail_if(~ TRUE, "Try changing the reference date to discharge date.")
)
```
